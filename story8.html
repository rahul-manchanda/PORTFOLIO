The on-ground moderators welcomed the attendees in their respective cities. Once Oracle's MD reached the stage, the DELHI CONSOLE took over all the master consoles and remotely managed all three cities in a seamless chronological format. This enabled a seamless live Q&A session, where the MD addressed questions not just from the 3 cities but from across the 14 remote locations.
